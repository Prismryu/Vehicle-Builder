## 📜 License

This application is covered under the MIT License.

## 📖 Description

A TypeScript-based command-line application that allows users to create and interact with vehicles including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and user interaction through a dynamic CLI interface.

Users can create a new vehicle, select an existing one, and perform various vehicle-specific actions. Built with TypeScript and the Inquirer package, this app models a real-world scenario in which a developer maintains and expands upon existing codebases.
